Project Description
The focus of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of input/output operations in Python. You will work on various tasks that involve reading and writing files, working with JSON data, and creating Python objects from JSON representations. By completing these tasks, you will improve your skills in handling different types of data and performing file operations in Python.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Why Python programming is awesome.
How to open a file.
How to write text in a file.
How to read the full content of a file.
How to read a file line by line.
How to move the cursor in a file.
How to make sure a file is closed after using it.
What the with statement is and how to use it.
What JSON is.
What serialization is.
What deserialization is.
How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string.
How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) style (PEP 8 compliant)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.doc)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").my_function.doc)' and python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.my_function.doc)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
