0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
Welcome to the Python programming project on if/else statements, loops, and functions. This project is designed to help you practice various programming concepts and problem-solving skills in both Python and C.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:

The benefits of Python programming
The significance of proper indentation in Python
Usage of if and if...else statements
Working with comments and variables
Utilizing while and for loops
Differences between Python's for loop and C's
Applying the break and continue statements
Using else clauses in loops
Understanding the purpose of the pass statement and when to use it
How to use the range function
Defining and using functions in Python
The behavior of functions without return statements
Scope of variables in Python
Concept of traceback in Python
Arithmetic operators and their usage
Requirements

All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
Files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3
Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style checks
All files must be executable
The length of files will be tested using wc
C Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
Files should end with a new line
Use the Betty style for code checks (betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
No global variables allowed
No more than 5 functions per file
Prototypes of functions should be included in the header file lists.h
Header files should be include guarded
Tasks
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. The goal is to print whether the number stored in the variable is positive, zero, or negative.

1. The last digit
Similar to the previous task, this program assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints its last digit along with certain conditions.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, without newline characters.

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Similar to the previous task, this program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

4. Hexadecimal printing
This program prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.

5. 00...99
A program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 with specific formatting.

6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

7. islower
A function that checks if a character is lowercase.

8. To uppercase
A function that prints a string in uppercase.

9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
A function that prints the last digit of a number.

10. a + b
A function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. a ^ b
A function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

12. Fizz Buzz
A function that prints numbers from 1 to 100 according to specific rules.

13. Insert in sorted linked list
A C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
