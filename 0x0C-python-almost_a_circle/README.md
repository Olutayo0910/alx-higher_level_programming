Project Description: This project is a part of the Higher Level curriculum and aims to help you review and practice various Python concepts. It covers topics such as object-oriented programming, unit testing, file handling, and more. You will be working with classes and modules to implement solutions for different tasks.

Background Context
The AirBnB project is a significant part of the Higher Level curriculum. This project will help you prepare for it. Throughout this project, you will review various Python concepts, including import, exceptions, classes, private attributes, getters and setters, class methods, static methods, inheritance, unit testing, and file I/O.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external assistance:

General:

What is unit testing and how to implement it in a large project.
How to serialize and deserialize a class.
How to read and write a JSON file.
What are *args and how to use them.
What are **kwargs and how to use them.
How to handle named arguments in a function.
Copyright and Plagiarism
You are responsible for coming up with solutions for the tasks in this project on your own. You are not allowed to copy and paste someone else's work. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

Requirements
Python Scripts:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
All your files should end with a new line.
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
All your files must be executable.
The length of your files will be tested using wc.
All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'.
All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'.
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'.
A documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
Python Unit Tests:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your test files should end with a new line.
All your test files should be inside a folder named tests.
You have to use the unittest module.
All your test files should be Python files (extension: .py).
All your test files and folders should start with test_.
